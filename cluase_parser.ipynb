I am the deep belly laugh that brings forth existence.\n",

    "3050\tWhen I am criticized I know there is something I must have missed, something I haven\\'t noticed or a dynamic at work that is causing the person criticizing me to see in me a gap of some sort. And while that gap may or may not be there in reality, it is in that person\\'s mind. This provides me the opportunity to explore that person\\'s mind or world view. I would like that exploration to result in growth for us both or at least to enhance our relationship.\n",
    "3051\tCrime and delinquency could be halted if we could see that the essence of who we are in unity and in variation are two side of one coin of WholnessIF we could see all \\\"other\\\" as our very own self, we could become privy to a Love that heals, that gently embraces the ways an Eternity postures and veils itself as a separation. in this embrace, the separation melts, because God is embraced at any level it shows its beautiful facein that embrace we feel heard and we feel whole...\n",
    "3052\tIf my mother I feel a pull to look back at my own upbringing and my mother's inevitable influence on my development. I am also aware of having moved beyond dwelling on unfinished business and see how much a trap that is for the ego and my identifying with the unmet need.

    "3053\tThese days, work Is something I continue to enjoy and take great pleasure in using it as a framework within which to continue my journey of discovery and fulfilment. Work is not separate to life. Work is part of living, of serving, of being useful. Indeed, one could call work - play. There is no separation. Whether I receive the appropriate value recognition or remuneration for my \"job\" is my judgement. Voluntary work, while unpaid, is the most rewarding, I find.\n",
    "3054\tChange is the shittiest fucking thing ever; I so wish reality was completely static sometimes... at least, so says some part of me, at least right now - the thirst for permanence comes in waves, and it's pretty strong in me today... did I mention I'm wrestling with a couple of big and difficult life changes at the moment? :-) This is not representative of how I usually respond to this stem or talk about change, it's just what I'm present to at the moment...\n",
    "3055\tBeing with other people Is being nested within the eternal field that moves through and within everything. Charged as though all animate and inanimate forms are breathing, being breathed by the causal whole, so too, being with other people is being with all forms and the divine currents that extend Everywhere. It is like feeling and seeing the Divine Eternity at eternal play within itself; the One through the many as we all dance as fullness, nested within a eternal expanse...\n",
    "3056\tMy main problem is being in my head rather than fully present and instead running trauma patterns habitsbeliefs of being a victim, feeling I need to please others and abandon myself and then be angry when not cared for by others.

    "3057\tPrivacy What can universal consciousness possibly conceive as 'private'...big laugh :) Still laughing :) :) This is hilarious. Everything is seen and is 'it' all of consciousness. In the localised expression of consciousness (as humans) at some levels and stages of development this is a great concern as it shows the humanity of fear, power, manipulation etc, all of which our evolution conspires to create (and also withhold its potential for unfolding). And this is so.\n",
    "3058\tChange is ...happening each day on the one side: kids grow, you realise you get older and remember less, circumstances of living are different today, then yesterday. So you need to \\\"change\\\" your plan of today, you need to be open and flexibel and adopt to it, for example. Changes of behaviour or values demand go much depper and need to be reflected first. It can enter in new developments, but it is difficult to achieve this - personal as well as from the perspective of a society.\n",

The Mission calls it \\'Harnessing the Power of Love\\'\n",

Together we enter shared containers of collective consciousness and collective heart. We explore who we are in this space and what is possible. We let go of our individual (subtle) egos and we practice trying on and owning identities grounded in more expansive perspectives. The ultimate goal is to share a planetary or Kosmic identity and once aligned, see what we can accomplish together as one.\"\"\")\n",
